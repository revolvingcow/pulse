pulse
=====

`pulse` is a console application with the sole purpose of promoting friendly competition
amongst co-workers. This version only connects to TFS (we tested only version 2013 but
we assume it will work with Visual Studio Online) at the moment.

How to run the program
======================

"""
pulse.exe "https://server:443/defaultcollection"
"""

Navigation
==========

To highlight a particular player simply use one of the following commands to highlight
the respective line:

 - Page Up/Down: Move up/down by 20 lines
 - Move Up/Down: Either in Vim tradition (J or K) or the arrow keys
 - Quit: Either in Vim tradition (Q) or with the Escape key

Maintenance
===========

After each successful pull of the commit log, work history, and projects the current
leaderboard is cached. This cache file is in simple delimited format so feel free to take
a look, but please no fudging the numbers! It only hurts morale...
